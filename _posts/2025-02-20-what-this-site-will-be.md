Here's the short of it:

- I was basically homeless during Thanksgiving. I spent the couple weeks in a place I will not name to find me a place to live.
- Having the debts I had through losing my job and having a major health expense meant that while my credit score is fine, I've maxed all my cards out. This makes it hard to find a place to rent.
- I cannot afford to keep paying for the storage unit where most of my gear is. The only things I am taking for homelab stuff, in the off chance I find an apartment, are my UniFi gear and my NUCs, and my Synology.
- Right now I live in a motel and while it's one of the best motels I've ever seen or lived in, the internet is excruciatingly slow. They allow extenders and I have found one in my price range but the drag on an already slow network with about 30-40 people sharing it isn't truly ideal. So all my homelab stuff is on hold for the foreseeable future.
- Now I need to pivot and this is what this post is about.

## What are you doing now?

One, I am back building software. The state of the world is as such that I am not sure if I'll ever work again. This means I need to take matters into my own hands to create my own work and gain my own income my own way.

Second, this site is pivoting to tools and DIY. No one reads this blog anyway, but I need to _actually_ get people to read it as it's going to be important to my... business which feels weird for me to even say.

So I'll need to focus on this blog and my software engineering blog. I have a personal blog for my bitching and moaning but that is just my little corner of the indie web.

## What about the old posts?

I will spin up another website so you can read them if you want to. I don't think I want them on this main site.

I also need to work on getting affiliate income. Nerds hate this, but these nerds are sitting on six figures and can go to Whole Foods. I am trying to just make ends meet and live half way comfortably so please shut up about what _I_ do on this website. Your input on how I run my site is not needed.

_You_ don't have to buy anything from any link I post. And for now, I am no longer part of the program as I drive _zero_ traffic here because of my hatred for marketing and selling. There's a time and place for principles on this but today just ain't the day.

## What is your business?

It isn't one yet, but if you want to know a skeleton or shell of what it is, it is called Pixel & Circuit and you can visit the bones of the website over at [Pixel & Circuit](https://pxlandcircuit.shop).

Thank you.

I am a _big time sucker_ for gadgets of all types and that includes power and manual tools.

Every Tuesday[^1] will be _Toolsday_ where I highlight a particular YouTube channel, tool, or tool haul[^2] on the blog. Sometimes I may even do a demonstration or review of a tool I've had or picked up recently.

I love tools and I've been going balls deep into Tool and DIY YouTube these past two months. Toolsday is the natural result of this.

[^1]: At least I'll _try_ to get one out every Tuesday.

[^2]: Mine or someone else's.

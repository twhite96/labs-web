I am still around! I am working on a loadout post for a Toolsday entry I started on literally this past Tuesday but taking and editing the photos has taken some time.

I've also started using Amazon Affiliate Links, which you can find the disclosure about on [the tab sidebar](/affiliate-disclousure/).


> I use non-invasive analytics with GoatCounter. However I have no issue with you blocking any analytics or affiliate linking stuff on this site. I get it. I do.

Things will be picking up here soon. Stay tuned!

In the meantime, here are a few pretty cool video from Morgan's Maintenance[^1] and Christian Lempa.

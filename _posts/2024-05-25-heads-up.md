I am still around! I am working on a loadout post for a Toolsday entry I started on literally this past Tuesday but taking and editing the photos has taken some time.

I've also started using Amazon Affiliate Links, which you can find the disclosure about on [the tab sidebar](/affiliate-disclousure/).

Things will be picking up here soon. Stay tuned!

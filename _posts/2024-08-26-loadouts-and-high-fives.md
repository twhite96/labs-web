I love tools. There is no getting around that fact. When you're building a PC or adding roll out shelves to your server rack good tools are important.

For years I got by using cheap tools from Dollar Tree or random tools I found laying around the places I lived or that my partner found and gave me[^1]. Never in my wildest dreams did I know that investing in *good tools* makes a world of difference.

## What is this about?

This is just a loadout post. What is a loadout? Well, it's just a tool bag with the kit you've collected, organized in an efficient way.

In late 2021 I bought my first *prosumer* tool in the DeWALT ATOMIC 20V MAX Cordless Brushless Drill/Driver from Home Depot. I didn't get to use it then and wouldn't be able to use it till the end of 2022 when I modified my Echogear server rack. I could tell almost immediately, how much *different* it was from using my old, cheap, Black & Decker. It had a quality to it I wasn't used to so I went full on *Yellow Camp*, picking up all the DeWALT tools I thought I may need; the box cutter with the removable blades, the utility knife, the socket set, the laser level with the leveler stand, the goggles. I had joined the *cult*, I suppose.

But after watching Morgan's Maintenence YouTube channel, I knew that it was ok to branch out to other tools and so I did.

## First tool bag

My first bag was a DeWALT handyman 12" tool bag which I bought earlier this year.

This bag was a bit *too tight* for all my tools but it worked well for a few months.

Just recently, I went looking for a bigger, more attractive, tool bag. Vera Pro bags are exquistely made and gorgeous but out of my price range[^2] so I focused on just getting a larger quality bag at a good price.

I found Foxrino 16" tool bag, made with a sturdy canvas and tough, hard, plastic feet. There is ample storage for my DeWALT drill, my Klein Tools screwdrivers, multimeter, and wire cutter, tools for networking and electical testing, and more.

The zippers are feel almost as good as YKK zippers, and it looks *great*. I am sure it will hold me over until I can finally get that sweet Vera Pro bag.

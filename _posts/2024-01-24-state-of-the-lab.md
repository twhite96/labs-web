It's been a almost two years since I shredded my quad and was bedridden for all of 2022 up until May of 2023.

Would have spent the whole of 2023 on the streets if not for close friends and family who allowed me to setup my gear in the small room I am in now.

I have managed to increase the amount of services running because of [Proxmox VE Helper Scripts](https://tteck.github.io/Proxmox/) while learning more of the homelab ropes from [TechnoTim's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@technotim). 

It has been a long day, so the only thing I feel like sharing are the photos to my new lab.

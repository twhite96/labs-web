I've been working on content  verticals for Suburban Smarts; things like writing reviews of smart home products, engaging in the Home Assistant community on Facebook[^1] and pumping out more content on this website and soon, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@tifflabs)[^2].

This is beginning to pay off for me in a big way:

I've been invited to an Amazon program that I can't remember if I can disclose here or not[^3] but I can tell you it'll make me want to create more content, right here on this blog.



[^1]: Trying to up my game in the forums, too.
[^2]: And failing *horribly*.
[^3]: I'll need to reread the *fine print*.

      With my new UniFi Ap up and running, I plan on migrating my cameras to different networks I created in the UniFi controller.

I am still learning about how to use a VLAN and how to set one up on my Ap.

So far, I’ve got a nice overview of traffic coming through my network.

I’ll be writing more soon.

  It’s been a minute, hasn’t it? I was busy at work, the startup life continuing to cause burnout for me, and the following tech crash meant that I would not be working for a few months as I tried to pick up the pieces of what remained of my work and move forward.


The recession has hit us all hard, some more than others, as 10s of thousands of tech workers have been laid off. I feel lucky th...

      A brief post here.

Getting into Home Assistant has been the best thing to happen to me in a long time. It has not only been fun, but as a software engineer by trade, it has made me better at my job and understanding the pipes that gird all the infrastructure I build apps on top of.

      I’ve been working on content  verticals for Suburban Smarts; things like writing reviews of smart home products, engaging in the Home Assistant community on Facebook1 and pumping out more content on this website and soon, YouTube2.

This is beginning to pay off for me in a big way:

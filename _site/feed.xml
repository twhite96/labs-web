  This will be short and sweet but necessary.


Here’s the short of it:


  I was basically homeless during Thanksgiving. I spent the couple weeks in a place I will not name to find me a place to live.
  Having the debts I had through losing my job and having a major health expense meant that while my credit score is fine, I’ve maxed all my cards out. This makes it hard to find a place to rent...

      I love tools. There is no getting around that fact. When you’re building a PC or adding roll out shelves to your server rack good tools are important.

For years I got by using cheap tools from Dollar Tree or random tools I found laying around the places I lived or that my partner found and gave me1. Never in my wildest dreams did I know that investing in good tools makes a world of difference....

      I am still around! I am working on a loadout post for a Toolsday entry I started on literally this past Tuesday but taking and editing the photos has taken some time.

I’ve also started using Amazon Affiliate Links, which you can find the disclosure about on the tab sidebar.


  I use non-invasive analytics with GoatCounter. However I have no issue with you blocking any analytics or affiliate l...

      I am a big time sucker for gadgets of all types and that includes power and manual tools.

Every Tuesday1 will be Toolsday where I highlight a particular YouTube channel, tool, or tool haul2 on the blog. Sometimes I may even do a demonstration or review of a tool I’ve had or picked up recently.

I love tools and I’ve been going balls deep into Tool and DIY YouTube these past two months. Toolsda...

      I’ve been wanting to get my Proxmox cluster plugged into my UDM Pro for at least a year now. A few issues were:


  Accessing the cluster from a different subnet
  Updating the IP address of each node in the cluster
  Keeping old LXC containers and VMs in tact
  Keeping HDD and SSD mountpoints in tact


Wait. Why?

You may be asking, “tiff, why move the cluster at all?” This is a fair thing to ...

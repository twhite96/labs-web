      It’s been a almost two years since I shredded my quad and was bedridden for all of 2022 up until May of 2023.

Would have spent the whole of 2023 on the streets if not for close friends and family who allowed me to setup my gear in the small room I am in now.

I have managed to increase the amount of services running because of Proxmox VE Helper Scripts while learning more of the homelab ropes ...

      I’ve had one going for a while but today, it’s cleanup day.



Some background…

Home Assistant got me into DevOps.

Don’t get me wrong, I was interested, but the more I read about Home Assistant and tinkered with it, the more When SysAdmins Ruled the Earth made sense1.

So I went all in with my first rack, an Aeons 9U rack from Amazon…


My friend had never done something like this, and while ...

      With my new UniFi Ap up and running, I plan on migrating my cameras to different networks I created in the UniFi controller.



I am still learning about how to use a VLAN and how to set one up on my Ap.

So far, I’ve got a nice overview of traffic coming through my network.

I’ll be writing more soon.

  It’s been a minute, hasn’t it? I was busy at work, the startup life continuing to cause burnout for me, and the following tech crash meant that I would not be working for a few months as I tried to pick up the pieces of what remained of my work and move forward.


The recession has hit us all hard, some more than others, as 10s of thousands of tech workers have been laid off. I feel lucky th...

      A brief post here.



Getting into Home Assistant has been the best thing to happen to me in a long time. It has not only been fun, but as a software engineer by trade, it has made me better at my job and understanding the pipes that gird all the infrastructure I build apps on top of.

It’s taken me a little under two years to feel comfortable with terms like:

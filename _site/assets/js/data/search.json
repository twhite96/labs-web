    "content": "  This will be short and sweet but necessary.Here’s the short of it:  I was basically homeless during Thanksgiving. I spent the couple weeks in a place I will not name to find me a place to live.  Having the debts I had through losing my job and having a major health expense meant that while my credit score is fine, I’ve maxed all my cards out. This makes it hard to find a place to rent.  I cannot afford to keep paying for the storage unit where most of my gear is. The only things I am taking for homelab stuff, in the off chance I find an apartment, are my UniFi gear and my NUCs, and my Synology.  Right now I live in a motel and while it’s one of the best motels I’ve ever seen or lived in, the internet is excruciatingly slow. They allow extenders and I have found one in my price range but the drag on an already slow network with about 30-40 people sharing it isn’t truly ideal. So all my homelab stuff is on hold for the foreseeable future.  Now I need to pivot and this is what this post is about.What are you doing now?One, I am back building software. The state of the world is as such that I am not sure if I’ll ever work again. This means I need to take matters into my own hands to create my own work and gain my own income my own way.Second, this site is pivoting to tools and DIY. No one reads this blog anyway, but I need to actually get people to read it as it’s going to be important to my… business which feels weird for me to even say.So I’ll need to focus on this blog and my software engineering blog. I have a personal blog for my bitching and moaning but that is just my little corner of the indie web.What about the old posts?I will spin up another website so you can read them if you want to. I don’t think I want them on this main site.I also need to work on getting affiliate income. Nerds hate this, but these nerds are sitting on six figures and can go to Whole Foods. I am trying to just make ends meet and live half way comfortably so please shut up about what I do on this website. Your input on how I run my site is not needed.You don’t have to buy anything from any link I post. And for now, I am no longer part of the program as I drive zero traffic here because of my hatred for marketing and selling. There’s a time and place for principles on this but today just ain’t the day.What is your business?It isn’t one yet, but if you want to know a skeleton or shell of what it is, it is called Pixel &amp; Circuit and you can visit the bones of the website over at Pixel &amp; Circuit.Thank you."

    "content": "I love tools. There is no getting around that fact. When you’re building a PC or adding roll out shelves to your server rack good tools are important.For years I got by using cheap tools from Dollar Tree or random tools I found laying around the places I lived or that my partner found and gave me1. Never in my wildest dreams did I know that investing in good tools makes a world of difference.What is this about?This is just a loadout post. What is a loadout? Well, it’s just a tool bag with the kit you’ve collected, organized in an efficient way.In late 2021 I bought my first prosumer tool in the DeWALT ATOMIC 20V MAX Cordless Brushless Drill/Driver from Home Depot. I didn’t get to use it then and wouldn’t be able to use it till the end of 2022 when I modified my Echogear server rack. I could tell almost immediately, how much different it was from using my old, cheap, Black &amp; Decker. It had a quality to it I wasn’t used to so I went full on Yellow Camp, picking up all the DeWALT tools I thought I may need; the box cutter with the removable blades, the utility knife, the socket set, the laser level with the leveler stand, the goggles. I had joined the cult, I suppose.But after watching Morgan’s Maintenence YouTube channel, I knew that it was ok to branch out to other tools and so I did.First tool bagMy first bag was a DeWALT handyman 12” tool bag which I bought earlier this year.This bag was a bit too tight for all my tools but it worked well for a few months.Just recently, I went looking for a bigger, more attractive, tool bag. Vera Pro bags are exquistely made and gorgeous but out of my price range2 so I focused on just getting a larger quality bag at a good price.I found Foxrino 16” tool bag, made with a sturdy canvas and tough, hard, plastic feet. There is ample storage for my DeWALT drill, my Klein Tools screwdrivers, multimeter, and wire cutter, tools for networking and electical testing, and more.The zippers are feel almost as good as YKK zippers, and it looks great. I am sure it will hold me over until I can finally get that sweet Vera Pro bag.My kitFoxrino tool bagKlein multimeter, small wire cutter, and POE testerEtekcity thermal gun, Dremel 3000 kitDeWALT 20V brushless drill/driverKlein automatic wire stripper/cutter, DeWALT driver bits and safety gogglesMicrofiber towel, RockSeed Laser Measure, DeWALT safety glovesRandom pliers, Milwaukee Fastback flip utility knife, Klein Flip socket screwdriver with built in bit storage and dual bit screwdriver, DeWALT hex keys, random ethernet cutter/stripper, Fowler calipersAffiliate LinksFoxrino 16” Wide Mouth Tool Bag - AmazonKlein Tools Precision Screwdriver 27-in-1 Multibit, Part #32328 - AmazonKlein Tools 14-in-1 Adjustable Screwdriver with Flip Socket, HVAC Nut Drivers, Part #32304 - AmazonKlein Tools MM325 Multimeter - AmazonKlein Tools11-in-1 Screwdriver Nut Driver Set, 8 Bits, Part #32500 - AmazonKlein Tools Self-adjusting Wire Stripper/Cutter Heavy Duty, Part #11061 - AmazonMilwaukee Hand Tools FASTBAK™️ Compact Flip Utility Knife - AmazonDewalt 20V Max Cordless Drill/Driver Kit, Part #DCD771c2 - AmazonEtekcity Infrared Thermometer Laser Temperature Gun - AmazonFowler Digital Caliper - AmazonDremel 3000 - AmazonRockSeed Laser Measure - Amazon            He is a big time lover of tools too. We were pretty broke so we did what we could. &#8617;              I am still looking for work after two years, thus why I passed on the Vera Pro and why this blog has affiliate links to things I legitimately use. I would never recommend something I don’t like or don’t use. Ever. &#8617;      "

    "content": "I’ve been wanting to get my Proxmox cluster plugged into my UDM Pro for at least a year now. A few issues were:  Accessing the cluster from a different subnet  Updating the IP address of each node in the cluster  Keeping old LXC containers and VMs in tact  Keeping HDD and SSD mountpoints in tactWait. Why?You may be asking, “tiff, why move the cluster at all?” This is a fair thing to ask because it was a headache and a half to get this working. The juice that made it worth the squeeze: The Unifi Network Application.Being able to monitor what is coming in and out of those nodes on my network is important to me.A few months back my Synology got hit with a barrage of bot attacks from someone scanning for open ports in Shodan or something. The only reason I knew was because I’d logged in to do something and noticed thousands of notifications DSM fly by each second. Luckily for me I’d hardened the security on my Synology well enough to withstand the days long barrage of bots but it would have been nicer to know ahead of time and, with more data at my disposal, know what to do about it, where the failure points were so I could mitigate something like that in the future.For my Proxmox cluster, this is especially critical because of the services I host on it. I am still learning as well so security is something I am implementing as I know more about how to lock down your services exposed to the web and having that data could be a useful tool in progressing with this.How I solved the issueThere are a few steps I took that I will link below. In the first GitHub gist,This was fine but I still couldn’t get three of my nodes to properly resolve the new IP addresses.I followed this Reddit post for guidance:Help! Cluster not ready - no quorum? (500) byu/cjalas inProxmoxResponse to OP that I used:  The following steps will unlink your cluster. You can create a new cluster of course. I’m just warning you.Comment byu/cjalas from discussion inProxmox"

    "content": "I’ve had one going for a while but today, it’s cleanup day.Some background…Home Assistant got me into DevOps.Don’t get me wrong, I was interested, but the more I read about Home Assistant and tinkered with it, the more When SysAdmins Ruled the Earth made sense1.So I went all in with my first rack, an Aeons 9U rack from Amazon…My friend had never done something like this, and while he’s handy, I am a better DIY’er for sureR putting the finishing touches on the rackThe finished rackThe cable management inside the cabinet is… rough. But it was my first cabinet.This was at my old old place, a 2br apartment in the suburbs where I live.Open or closed cabinet? Who knows…I wasn’t happy with the rack being so low off the ground; I am really tall, and sitting in my office chair trying to fix things in the cabinet was tedious. Sure, I could squat and do it, but I am old and my knees hurt. There was no way that was going to happen, hence my friend R putting the cabinet together2.I decided to pick up an Echogear rack, 15U, where everything would be easy to fix and modify. But as you can see, the cables are… well, still bad.Closer look at the lab area of my old officeThe whole office, in blueThe worstSince I spun up that lab, life has gotten significantly worse, for me and for everyone in my industry. Inflation rising means there’s less VC cash being invested and burned on stupid novelties from small startups, and layoffs continue to happen. I was one of the unlucky ones.It was bad because I’d just moved to a townhouse, hoping to have a garage lab, but the morning after I moved, after just 6 hours sleep, I shredded my quad being old and trying to get up from a very low position in an awkward way.So now, I have a house, I am still working, but I cannot walk. At work we get another round of funding but the market is drying up for our product and the suits are skittish. The funding round was good but it wasn’t enough to keep everyone, and there were only three proper employees, the rest of the team were contractors. This meant, the software engineer that worked on the least important product (that was me), got the pink slip. My boss left too, it was hard, but I got through it.This meant, however, that I’d need to rely on my savings and investments. It helped but my runway ran out, too, so I had to move again, and with inflation the way it is, I am now couch surfing with old family friends. Stuff happens, but I am in a warm, safe, place and can finally walk without limping.In a roomMy roommate allowed me to bring most of my gear along. I hastily threw it all together and it looks like it.This is an absolute abominationBut I’ve found the resolve to fix it, even though I am expecting to get my own place in the near future3.Stripping, cutting, and putting headers on ethernet cablesStep one, before I even tear this thing down, is to make sure I have the appropriate length for each component’s ethernet cable. As you can see, the runs are all kind of different lengths and colors which makes it not only unappealing to look at but a PITA to fix things. Nothing is labled, different colors for different types of devices where things of different types should be grouped. NUCs not put in racks just on top of other NUCs and not labeled. Raspberry Pis dangling. And the whole rack is ass backwards so the switches are hard to reach. There are power bricks daisy chained on the CyberPower power strip and I don’t want that at all.Several power bricks have different lengths and some of the bricks take up two or three outlets, meaning I need to daisy chain and add more and more power bricks. It isn’t ideal at all and I need to fix it. Pronto.Tools of the tradeI bought an ethernet cutter/stripper kit to work with the cables. I will be purchasing a few spools of different colored cables and documenting which devices get which colors and what ports they are plugged into with Bookstack, my network documentation tool of choice.(There’s a video on Bookstack coming soon. I’ll link it here once I finish editing it.)The stuff I’ve accumlated over the past 8 years is wild. Thanks Adafruit!And more projects…I have a whole host of Arduino and ESPHome boards I am going to be using to enhance my smart home4.I am excited to:  Clean up the rack  Build cool stuff  Move to my own place(!!!)

I was busy at work, the startup life continuing to cause burnout for me, and the following tech crash meant that I would not be working for a few months as I tried to pick up the pieces of what remained of my work and move forward.The recession has hit us all hard, some more than others, as 10s of thousands of tech workers have been laid off. I feel lucky that I don’t feel like I’ll be on the market for long and that I can finally create the content I want across my entire suite of blogs and YouTube channels.Now, on with the article.I have recently been down a large rabbit hole with my favorite home automation software, Home Assistant. You can expose as much or as little of your smart home to the wider internet or move everything off the cloud and keep your devices local behind a firewall and separated from your main network and a VLAN.I’m not interested in ligating this at the moment; what I want to write about today is Home Assistant dashboards.What are dashboards?Dashboards are just that; a place where you can collect different aspects of your Home Assistant instance using Lovelace cards that display that information in a visual way.I am trying to figure out who my audience is for this blog so please keep that in mind while reading this. If this is too basic for you, reach out to me so that I can understand what you want to read, what you don’t, and your skill level and I’ll adjust these articles based on that feedback.Can you please just show me examples??Sure! Here are a few of my dashboards in Home Assistant below.Have an interesting dashboard?I’d like to hear from you! You can send me your dashboards at dashboards at tiff labs dot org.Thanks!"

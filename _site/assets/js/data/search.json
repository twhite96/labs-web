    "content": "  It’s been a minute, hasn’t it? I was busy at work, the startup life continuing to cause burnout for me, and the following tech crash meant that I would not be working for a few months as I tried to pick up the pieces of what remained of my work and move forward.The recession has hit us all hard, some more than others, as 10s of thousands of tech workers have been laid off. I feel lucky that I don’t feel like I’ll be on the market for long and that I can finally create the content I want across my entire suite of blogs and YouTube channels.Now, on with the article.I have recently been down a large rabbit hole with my favorite home automation software, Home Assistant. You can expose as much or as little of your smart home to the wider internet or move everything off the cloud and keep your devices local behind a firewall and separated from your main network and a VLAN.I’m not interested in ligating this at the moment; what I want to write about today is Home Assistant dashboards.What are dashboards?Dashboards are just that; a place where you can collect different aspects of your Home Assistant instance using Lovelace cards that display that information in a visual way.I am trying to figure out who my audience is for this blog so please keep that in mind while reading this. If this is too basic for you, reach out to me so that I can understand what you want to read, what you don’t, and your skill level and I’ll adjust these articles based on that feedback.Can you please just show me examples??Sure! Here are a few of my dashboards in Home Assistant below.Have an interesting dashboard?I’d like to hear from you! You can send me your dashboards at dashboards at Suburban Smarts dot org.Thanks!"

    "content": "A brief post here.Getting into Home Assistant has been the best thing to happen to me in a long time. It has not only been fun, but as a software engineer by trade, it has made me better at my job and understanding the pipes that gird all the infrastructure I build apps on top of.It’s taken me a little under two years to feel comfortable with terms like:  Proxmox  NGINX  NGINX Proxy Manager  Docker  Portainter  VMs  Bittorrent  How to tunnel traffic securely by using Cloudflare and NPM to and from Home Assistantand more.These were terms I’d heard of but never understood and was too scared to find out more about.Now I have a small home lab and switches everywhere.I am neurodivergent and these past three years have been incredibly difficult for me. Diving into Home Assistant, DevOps, and building apps has literally saved my life more times than I can count.WelpThat got a bit mushy at the end there innit.But it’s true. And at the end of the day, it’s fun."

Tiff Labs is a site for the beginning homelab and self-hosted enthusiast. The aim is to share what I am learning while leveling myself and my readers, all two of you, (hi cuz!), up to become IT Pros.

The topics here are broad but niche; Home Automation with Home Assistat, Self Hosting/Homelab topics, and tool hauls and reviews can all be found here.

Enjoy.
